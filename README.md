PHP interview assignment


Your task is to build a simple web-based image hosting service. Users can upload pictures and write
descriptions for them. Users can also set pictures as favorites. Pictures favorited by a user
appear on the user's home page. Users can also delete pictures that they uploaded.

You have to implement the following user stories:

- As a user, I want to upload an image. (ajax)
- As a user, I want to add a description to an image. (ajax)
- As a user, I want to view an image. (ajax)
- As a user, I want to download an image.
- As a user, I want to favorite an image. (ajax)
- As a user, I want to download N random images from flickr and store them in my account. (ajax)

You have high expecations from your web app and figure that it's best to provide an API for
developers. The API should allow the developer to do all of the above using calls to the API. You
can design and implement the API however you want. Of course, we'd also like to see an API client.


Rules:

- You are not allowed to use any PHP framework. However, you are free to use any PHP library.
- You get bonus points for writing unit/functional tests.
- Provite a configuration file and instructions for how to run the app on our machines.
- Provide a .sql file for creating the database.
- Not required, but it would be great if you can host the app on the Internet so that we can play
  with it without having to install/configure it. ;-)
